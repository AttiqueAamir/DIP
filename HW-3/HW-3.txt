Problem-1:
Denoise the image (Img-1) using Butterworth Notch Reject filter of order 4. Show the noisy image, clean image, and the noise pattern (by taking IDFT of the filtered out frequencies) in juxtaposition. Note: Use appropriate values of cutoff frequencies taking guidance from the DFT spectrum of the image.

Problem-2:
Denoise the image (Img-2) using Butterworth Band Reject filter of order 4. Show the noisy image, clean image, and the noise pattern (by taking IDFT of the filtered out frequencies) in juxtaposition. Note: Use appropriate values of cutoff frequency and the band width taking guidance from the DFT spectrum of the image.

Submit a hardcopy (PDF) report detailing the solution procedures for the above problems, the results (images), their analyses, and the code (as annexure to the report).
